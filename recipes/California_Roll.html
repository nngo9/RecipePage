    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>4 half sheets of sushi grade nori(seaweed)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seed (this is optional)</li>
        <li>8 pieces of imitation crab or real crab</li>
        <li>1 small cucumber to cut into small sticks</li>
        <li>1 avocado to slice into thin pieces</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Season rice with rice vinegar, fanning and stirring until its room temperature.</li>
        <li>On a rolling mat, place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing downwards.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place onto the nori. Spread the rice evenly
            throughout the nori without mashing the rice. Season the rice with a pinch of sesame seeds
            if you're using them and then flip it over so the nori is facing upwards.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange in a horizontal row 1 inch(2.5cm) from the bottom,
             the crab followed by a row of avocado and a row of cucumber.
        </li>
        <li>Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the extra space
            at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make a nice tight roll.
            Squeeze down along the way to keep the roll from holding its shape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel before slicing
             the roll into six equal portions.
        </li>
        <li>Bon appetit!</li>
    </ol>
